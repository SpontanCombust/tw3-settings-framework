## Synopsis
Framework for modding Witcher 3 that simplifies the pipeline of using mod settings by generating code based directly on mod menu XML and providing extendible interface for reacting to changes of settings.

## Overview
Witcher 3 allows for creating custom mod menus which provide an interface between the mod developer and the end user to further customize their experience. The way settings are accessed in game's scripts is not complicated, but can often result in very boilerplaty code and situations when settings can be fetched improperly simply due to some typo. This framework is trying to midigate that.

Framework provides xml parser program. It generates WitcherScript code which mirrors the structure of customisable variables in the xml and assures on compile time that the developer uses their variables properly - no way for typos, bad type cast or other headaches.


## Instructions for mod users

1. Go to the [releases page](https://github.com/SpontanCombust/tw3-settings-framework/releases)
2. Download `TW3_MSF_Hooks_vX.XX.zip` appropriate for you game version and copy to the `Mods` directory

:information_source: *With the addition of code annotations introoduced in hotfix patch 4.04a_REDkit on 06.06.2024 all future game versions can use `v4.04a_REDkit+` hooks*

3. Download `TW3_MSF_modSettingsFramework.zip` and copy to the `Mods` directory
4. Use Script Merger to solve any conflicts
5. (Optional) See [remarks](#remarks)

## Instructions for mod developers

1. Do everything in the [mod user section](#instructions-for-mod-users)

2. Download newest `TW3_MSF_Parser.zip` and unpack it anywhere. Use the `settings_parser.exe` program on the menu xml of your mod

```shell
./settings_parser "../../doc/mod-menu.xml"
Group MODtab2 at line 40, column 6 has no vars and will be ignored.
Successfully parsed ../../doc/mod-menu.xml into ../../doc/mod-menu.ws
```
Parser can generate WitcherScript by the means of simply drag-and-dropping the XML file onto exe. It is however recommended to use it with some kind of command line prompt to see any warnings or errors it might return. To see all the possible options that can be used with the parser use the `--help` (shorhand `-h`) option or check the latest [parser CLI specification](doc/cli_specification.md).

Parser expects custom XML attributes to generate code. Check the [details](doc/details.md) and [xml specification](doc/xml_specification.md) for more information.

4. Add generated script file to your mod structure 
   
5. Use the settings object in your mod

Let's first look at an example of using settings with what vanilla game provides.
```js
var config : CInGameConfigWrapper = theGame.GetInGameConfigWrapper();

if(config.GetVarValue('MODtab1', 'MODtoggle'))
{
	doSomething();
	config.SetVarValue('MODtab1', 'MODsliderInt', IntToString(50));
	theGame.SaveUserSettings();
}
```

Now let's see how the above can be improved with the framework. 
```js
var settings : MyModSettings = GetMyModSettings();

if(settings.tab1.toggle)
{
	doSomething();
	settings.tab1.sliderInt = 50;
	settings.WriteSettings();
}
```

The structure of the generated settings class is meant to resemble the structure of the XML. The class contains variables analogous to XML's Group nodes. Those variables in turn contain variables which are equivalent to individual Var nodes. Their types are appropriate, for example a variable for TOGGLE will be of type bool and a SLIDER variable will be either int or float depending on whether said slider can produce fractions. <br>
Now instead of using CInGameConfigWrapper's methods to access user configuration you can use this dedicated settings object in a less boiler-platy way.
Aside from having simple variables in place of function calls the framework provides such features as value validation and generating enums from options vars. Be sure to check out the [documentation](#documentation) and try experimenting with different configurations.

6. (Optional) Extend settings master

If the basic functionality that framework classes provided is not enough for you you can extend the settings class generated by the parser and use that child class instead.
The most common usage of this would be overriding `ReadSettings()` method to run arbitrary code whenever the settings class gets updated. To see all the functions available for overriding refer to the [class specification](doc/class_specification.md) or code itself.


## Remarks

### Version migrations

- v1.0 <br>
Framework hasn't received any new features by itself since v0.6. It has however been repackaged to be able to be used on different game versions through the seperation of vanilla `hooks` from the local game-version-agnostic scripts.
If you have `modSettingsFramework` from previous framework versions, delete it completely and reinstall, this time together with hooks.

- v0.6 <br>
Script files generated by pre-v0.6 version parsers and therefore mods using them are not compatible with the later versions of `modSettingsFramework` and can't be mixed.
If you're a mod creator, please reparse you XMLs for this version.
Also, most of the data that previously had to be passed into the CLI now has to be put directly in the XML. Therefore the process of parsing said file has been changed to some degree.
